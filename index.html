<p>The purpose of this website is quite simple: to showcase my data science skills and various projects that I have contributed to. It's also here so that 
people can get to know me better. So, I hope you enjoy looking at the various projects below and come back soon to see what new data driven adventures I have 
embarked on. Thanks for visiting!</p>

<h1 id="header-1"><a href="#header-1"></a>Who Am I?</h1>
<p>The simple answer to this question is that I am a student who attends UC Davis, and is majoring in statistics and pursuing a minor in computer science. All of 
this is quite true, but I am also a huge fan of basketball, especially the Golden State Warriors, but I thoroughly enjoy watching ALL basketball. If not for my tendency 
to get injured while running or playing basketball, I would be probably be balling right now. Besides that I love to listen to wide variety of music, read a wide variety
of literature, and am starting to eat a wider variety of food. I think that covers most everything. If you have any questions about of my projects or just want to 
get in touch with me feel free to email me at ckashyap(at)ucdavis(dot)edu.</p>
